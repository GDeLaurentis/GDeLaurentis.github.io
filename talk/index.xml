      <title>Towards the complete NNLO BFKL Kernel</title>
      <link>https://gdelaurentis.github.io/talk/refoct2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there has been significant progress in understanding the
Regge limit in massless scattering amplitudes. In particular, all
the ingredients needed for the computation of the BFKL kernel at
NNLO have been determined in QCD, apart from the two-gluon
central emission vertex at one loop, which is known so far only
in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present the
calculation of the next-to-multi-Regge-kinematic (NRMK) limit of
the six-gluon amplitude in QCD, from which this vertex can be
determined. Due to the complexity of the expressions for the
next-to-maximally-helicity-violating (NMHV) amplitude and the
high powers of spurious poles in the NMRK expansion parameter, we
use p-adic evaluation to obtain numerical samples for the leading
NMRK behaviour. We then employ analytic reconstruction techniques
to recover analytic results in a minimal set of independent
variables. In particular, allowed partial fraction depositions
are identified through nested p-adic limits near codimension-two
varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analytic Reconstruction and Algebro-Geometric Structures in QCD: Two-Loop $pp \rightarrow Vjj$ &amp; One-Loop $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}H$ &amp; $HHH$</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop amplitudes are central to precision collider phenomenology, yet their computation remains a major challenge due to the complexity of intermediate steps. A powerful modern strategy is to bypass this complexity through numerical evaluations over finite fields, followed by the reconstruction of the amplitudesâ€™ analytic form from a set of numerical samples using number-theoretic and algebro-geometric techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present the recent re-computation of the two-loop leading-colour amplitudes for the production of a heavy electroweak vector boson, $V=\{W^\pm,Z,\gamma^*\}$, in association with two light jets at hadron colliders ($pp\rightarrow Vjj$) (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2503.10595&lt;/a&gt;), including leptonic decays of the electroweak boson ($V\rightarrow \ell\bar{\ell}$). Compared to the previous state-of-the-art result (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07541&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2110.07541&lt;/a&gt;), the new approach achieves a three-order-of-magnitude reduction in size (1.4 GB to 1.9 MB), while also lowering the number of required numerical samples from one million to fifty thousand. To illustrate the applicability of these techniques in settings with more massive external legs, I will also briefly discuss the one-loop processes $pp \to HHH$ and $pp \to t\bar t H$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will outline the core ingredients of this computation: a basis-change algorithm in the vector space of rational functions based on correlations among multivariate residues; numerical sampling in number fields with non-Archimedean metrics (finite fields and $p$-adic numbers); the use of redundant spinor-helicity variables organised via polynomial quotient rings; and the role of primary decompositions in identifying allowed multivariate partial fraction decompositions. These methods not only yield efficient and stable results ready for phenomenological applications, but also expose structural features that we expect to generalise to more complex multi-loop amplitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop amplitudes are essential ingredients in precision simulations of particle collisions at the LHC. Their computation poses both conceptual and computational challenges. A powerful and increasingly popular strategy to bypass intermediate bottlenecks in integrand reduction is to first evaluate amplitudes numerically over finite fields, and then recover their analytic form through analytic reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present two recent computations of fully analytic amplitudes obtained using this approach. The first is for the two-loop process $pp\rightarrow V(\rightarrow \bar\ell\ell)jj$ in the leading-color approximation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2503.10595&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, we revisited a previous result (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07541&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2110.07541&lt;/a&gt;) and drastically simplified the amplitude from 1.4 GB to 1.9 MB, while also reducing the number of numerical samples from 1 million to 50 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second computation is for the one-loop amplitude for $q\bar{q}\rightarrow t\bar{t}H$
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19909&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2504.19909&lt;/a&gt;). This is the first time an amplitude has been reconstructed in the massive spinor-helicity formalism, which provides a minimal parametrisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will outline key aspects of both computations, focusing on the reconstruction technique, and in particular the role of minimal spinor-helicity parametrisations, the choice of efficient bases for master integral coefficients, and their representation via multivariate partial fractions. In this way, we uncover structural features of the amplitudes and provide numerically stable and efficient implementations suitable for phenomenological applications and further theoretical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider two-loop QCD corrections in the leading color approximation for the production of a heavy electroweak vector boson, $V=\{W^\pm,Z,\gamma^*\}$, in association with two light jets ($Vjj$) at hadron colliders. Leptonic decays of the electroweak boson are included at the amplitude level. We develop an approach that allows us to derive an analytic representation three orders of magnitude smaller than previously known results. This approach combines an improved choice of bases for rational coefficients, the construction of judiciously partial-fractioned ansÃ¤tze, and iterative reconstruction in singular limits. We identify several recurring features of the amplitudes that we expect will facilitate analytic reconstruction and optimization of analytic representation for more complex amplitudes in the future. Finally, we provide an efficient and stable C++ numerical implementation of our results, ready for phenomenological applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I present recent efforts to tame the algebraic complexity of two-loop five-point scattering amplitudes in the spinor helicity formalism. These amplitudes are required, for instance, to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order predictions for the production of three jets or of a massive vector boson with two jets at the Large Hadron Collider. I review the method of numerical generalized and the integrand decomposition technique employed to generate finite-field or p-adic samples of the amplitudes. I then focus on the study of the analytic properties of the rational coefficients and their reconstruction from said numerical samples. I show how to exploit correlations among codimension-one residues to simplify the calculation. I touch upon various interdisciplinary aspects, including elements of number theory, computational algebraic geometry, constraint programming, memoization, and GPU acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present the recent calculation of the two-loop amplitudes required to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order predictions for three-jet production at the Large Hadron Collider. This calculation is performed in full color, that is including contributions from non-planar Feynman diagrams. I review the method of numerical generalized unitarity and the integrand decomposition technique employed to generate finite-field samples of the amplitude. I will then focus on the analytic reconstruction of the coefficient functions from said numerical samples. A novel algorithm, based on the correlation of codimension-one residues, helps tame the complexity of the calculation. Rescalings of the gluon amplitude, inspired by supersymmetry Ward identities, facilitate the computation of the quark amplitudes. I touch upon various interdisciplinary aspects of the computation, including elements of number theory, computational algebraic geometry, constraint programming, memoization, and GPU acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will present the computation of the NNLO double-virtual subleading-color corrections to the production of three photons at hadron colliders. I will briefly review the numerical generalized unitarity computation over finite fields performed with the C++ code Caravel, including updates that made this computation possible. I will then formulate the rational reconstruction problem for the finite remainders in spinor variables and obtain compact analytic expressions. Finally, I will show the effect of the subleading-color corrections on the hard functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalised unitarity and on-shell recursion relations have led to the automation of numerical computations for high multiplicity NLO matrix elements, whereas analytical expression are often still too complicated to be determined. I will present a new method (arXiv:1904.04067) to generate such analytic expressions using numerical evaluations only. We use high precision arithmetic to explore the singularity structure of the coefficients and decompose them into parts of manageable complexity. Each part is isolated by choosing an appropriate region of phase space, and reconstructed by solving a system of linear equations for the coefficients of a generic ansatz.
